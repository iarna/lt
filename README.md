# lt

lt is a small time tracking library and CLI. It is designed with extensibility
in mind; either by embedding the library or extending the CLI.

- Each task must have a unique id.
- One task can run at a time.

lt uses [LevelDB](http://leveldb.org) for data storage. Right now it only works
with node, but there are modules that enable the LevelDB API to be used with
IndexedDBâ€”so we could probably make it work in browsers, too.

**Install `lt` CLI:**

`npm i -g lt-timer`

# cli usage

[lt start [$id]](#lt-start-id)  
[lt stop](#lt-stop)  
[lt add $id $value](#lt-add-id-value)  
[lt subtract $id $value](#lt-subtract-id-value)  
[lt ls [$id]](#lt-ls-id)  
[lt log](#lt-log)

***

## lt start [$id]

Start a timer. If there is a running timer, lt will stop it. If no id is
provided, lt will resume the last timer that was stopped.

`lt start foo`

## lt stop

Stop the running timer.

## lt add $id $value

Add a specific value to a timer. The value should include units, for example:

- 30m
- 0.5h
- 2hr
- 4d
- 4.5h
- 4h30m

`lt add foo 1h7m`

## lt subtract $id $value

Subtract a specific value from a timer. The value should include units,
for example:

- 30m
- 0.5h
- 2hr
- 4d
- 4.5h
- 4h30m

`lt subtract foo 37m`

## lt ls [$id]

List the existing timers and the current duration of each. If a timer is
running, it's id will be highlighted.

If an id is provided, only the matching timer will be listed.

## lt log

Event log for all timers.
